serverkit
=========

first of all this is not a final produc!, this is only a conecpt that I need and I think other web developers might also need

as a web developer who is so familare with server side languages such as PHP, Ruby, Python etc, I want to utilize my knowldge in web development to build for mac app store to earn $$$
there are some solutions which will allow us -web developers- to build for mac app store however non of them will allow you to use PHP or Ruby except TideSDK, but the problem with TideSDK that It will allow you to inject Ruby code not ROR framework
,TideSDK will allow you to use PHP but it is not possible to use PHP frameworks such as Laravel, Codeigniter, etc.

the concept for this project is
combine
1- webkit
2- nginx (portable)
3- sqlite
4- Cordova

combine them in mac application that have only webview as (webkit) and have also nginx linked to this webview
the users can build a normal website with thier preferred language and framwork PHP,ROR, etc
then they have to complie the application from xcode, and ship it to mac app store
Build for mac app store using  a stack of nginx+webkit+sqlite+Cordova, so you can build mac applications using PHP, ROR, etc




I asked a question in stackover flow long time ago but answers, so I had to create this repo to market for this concept
